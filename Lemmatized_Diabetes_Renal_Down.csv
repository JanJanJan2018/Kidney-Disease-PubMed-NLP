Zinc-finger RNA-binding protein that destabilizes several cytoplasmic AU-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNA transcripts by promoting their poly(A) tail removal or deadenylation, and hence provide a mechanism for attenuating protein synthesis (PubMed:9703499, PubMed:10330172, PubMed:10751406, PubMed:11279239, PubMed:12115244, PubMed:12748283, PubMed:15187101, PubMed:15634918, PubMed:17030620, PubMed:16702957, PubMed:20702587, PubMed:20221403, PubMed:21775632, PubMed:27193233, PubMed:23644599, PubMed:25815583).

Recruits deadenylase CNOT7 (and probably the CCR4-NOT complex) via association with CNOT1, and hence promotes ARE-mediated mRNA deadenylation (PubMed:23644599).
