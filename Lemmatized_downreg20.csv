Summary
    Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in various types of cell motility and in maintenance of the cytoskeleton. Three main groups of actin isoforms have been identified in vertebrate animals: alpha, beta, and gamma. The alpha actins are found in muscle tissues and are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins co-exist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton and as mediators of internal cell motility. Actin gamma 1, encoded by this gene, is a cytoplasmic actin found in all cell types.

"This gene encode a protein that be a regulator of cellular growth and proliferation. Its mRNA be highly structure and contain a oligopyrimidine tract ( 5' - TOP ) in its 5' untranslated region that function to repress its translation under quiescent condition. The encode protein be involve in a variety of cellular pathway, include apoptosis, protein synthesis and cell division. It bind to and stabilize microtubule, and removal of this protein through phosphorylation be require for progression through mitotic and meiotic cell division. This gene be know to play a role in carcinogenesis, and be upregulated in some cancer cell. Alternative splice result in multiple transcript variant encode different isoform.","TPT1","DownRegulatedTop20","This gene encodes a protein that is a regulator of cellular growth and proliferation.
