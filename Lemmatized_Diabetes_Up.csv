To produce a MHC class II molecule that present a antigen, three MHC class II molecule ( heterodimer of a alpha and a beta chain ) associate with a CD74 trimer in the ER to form a heterononamer.

Diseases associated with HLA-DPB1 include Chronic Beryllium Disease and Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis. Among its related pathways are TCR signaling (REACTOME) and Phagosome. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include peptide antigen binding. An important paralog of this gene is HLA-DQB1. Binds peptides derived from antigens that access the endocytic route of antigen presenting cells (APC) and presents them on the cell surface for recognition by the CD4 T-cells. The peptide binding cleft accommodates peptides of 10-30 residues. The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules are generated mostly by degradation of proteins that access the endocytic route, where they are processed by lysosomal proteases and other hydrolases. Exogenous antigens that have been endocytosed by the APC are thus readily available for presentation via MHC II molecules, and for this reason this antigen presentation pathway is usually referred to as exogenous. As membrane proteins on their way to degradation in lysosomes as part of their normal turn-over are also contained in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, exogenous antigens must compete with those derived from endogenous components.
