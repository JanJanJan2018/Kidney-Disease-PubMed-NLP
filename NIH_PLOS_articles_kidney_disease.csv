Treatment protocol 	nSPH formation: hKEpC were thawed and grown as 2D monolayers for 5-7 days. Upon reaching confluency of 80-100%, the cells were harvested and seeded on poly (2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (poly-HEMA; Sigma-Aldrich)-precoated plates, in serum free medium (SFM), at a concentration of 5.5?13x104 cells/mL. SFM was comprised of N2 medium (Biological Industries) supplemented with 1% Pen-strep 100M, 1% L-glutamine, 0.4% B27 supplement (Gibco), 4æg/ml heparin sodium (Intramed), 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 0.2% CD Lipid concentrate (all purchased from Invitrogen), 2.4mg/ml glucose, 0.4mg/ml transferrin, 10mg/ml insulin, 38.66æg/ml putrescine, 0.04% sodium selenite, 12.6æg/ml progesterone (all from Sigma-Aldrich), 10ng/ml FGF and 20ng/ml EGF.
Growth protocol 	Human kidney samples were retrieved from the borders of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumors resected from partial and total nephrectomy patients. Collected tissues were washed with PBS,weighed and minced into ~1 mm slices using sterile surgical scalpels. The dissected tissue was then incubated for two hours at 37øC with Iscoves' Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) .(Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.1% collagenase IV (Invitrogen). The digested tissue was sieved through 100 æm cell strainers to achieve a single cell suspension. The medium was removed by centrifugation and the cells were resuspended in growth medium and plated on gelatin-coated T175 flasks. Serum containing medium (SCM) was comprised of IMDM (Biological Industries) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% Pen-strep 100M, 1% L-glutamine (both purchased from Biological industries), 100 ng/ml EGF, 100 ng/ml bFGF and 10 ng/ml SCF (all growth factors were purchased from Peprotech Asia).

Abstract

Metals are widespread pollutants in the environment which have been reported to be associated with kidney dysfunction in many existing epidemiological studies. However, most of the studies are cross-sectional design and mainly focus on several toxic metals including arsenic, lead and cadmium. Therefore, we conducted this prospective study within the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort to evaluate the associations of plasma multiple metals with the decline in kidney function among Chinese middle-aged and elderly. In total, 1434 participants free of chronic diseases at baseline were included in analysis. We measured baseline plasma concentrations of 23 metals and calculated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation based on serum creatinine, age, sex and ethnicity. Bonferroni correction was used for multiple testing to reduce the probability of a type I error. Principal component analysis was conducted to evaluate the combined effect of multiple metal co-exposure. Most of the plasma metal concentrations were within the literature reported reference values, whereas the concentration of lead and nickel exceeded the guideline value. We found that plasma concentrations of aluminum, arsenic, barium, lead, molybdenum, rubidium, strontium, vanadium and zinc were significantly associated with the decline in kidney function measured by annual eGFR decline, rapid renal function decline (defined as an annual decline in eGFR ò 5 mL/min/1.73 m2) or incident eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, with the adjusted beta coefficients (95% CI) for annual eGFR decline 0.50 (0.30, 0.69), 0.98 (0.74, 1.23), 0.56 (0.32, 0.79), 0.21 (0.03, 0.39), 0.35 (0.16, 0.54), 0.94 (0.71, 1.17), 0.37 (0.15, 0.60), 0.78 (0.54, 1.02), and 0.74 (0.57, 0.91), respectively. The metals exposures were linked with increased risks of impaired kidney function. Associations of principal components representing these metals with the decline in kidney function were significant and suggest a possible additional health risk by co-exposure. Participants engaged in manufacturing had higher plasma levels of several metals compared with those who had been involved in management- or administration-related work. Our findings suggest that exposure to multiple metals contribute to the decline in kidney function among the middle-aged and elderly. Co-exposure to multiple metals may have synergetic effect on the kidney function. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings and clarify the potential mechanisms.",PubMed

Abstract

Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and kidney injury are the major complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Although the underlying mechanisms for the development of these complications are not yet fully understood, it has been proposed that emergence of aGVHD contributes to the development of kidney injury after HSCT. We have shown previously that aGVHD targets the kidney in a biphasic manner: at the onset, inflammatory genes are up-regulated, while when aGVHD becomes established, donor lymphocytes infiltrate the kidney. Here, we characterize renal manifestations at the onset of aGVHD. Mice receiving allogeneic bone marrow and spleen cells displayed symptoms of aGVHD and elevated serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-à) and interferon gamma (IFN-?) within 4 days. There was concurrent kidney injury with the following characteristics: (1) elevated expression of the kidney injury biomarker, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), (2) accumulation of hetero-lysosomes in proximal tubule epithelial cells, and (3) reductions in àKlotho mRNA and protein and increased serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (Fgf23), phosphate and urea. This situation resembled acute renal injury caused by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. We conclude that the onset of aGVHD is associated with kidney injury involving down-regulation of àKlotho, a sight that may inspire novel therapeutic approaches.

Abstract

The main aim of present study is to evaluate the effect of miR-30b on the function of human proximal tubular epithelial cell line HK-2 cells. For this purpose, miRNA was loaded in an ionically cross-linked polysaccharide nanoparticle. The authors have demonstrated the influence of miR-30b mimic and inhibitor in HK-2 cell killing effect. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased the level of inflammatory cytokines of TNF-à, IL-1? and level was further increased with the treatment of PAg-miR mimic consistent with the cell viability assay. Interestingly, PAg-miR inhibitor significantly downregulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines and thereby reduced the inflammation in the body. Western blot analysis showed that LPS induced severe apoptosis of HK-2 cells and the apoptosis was further promoted by the PAg-miR (mimic). In contrast, PAg-miR (inhibitor) alleviated the apoptosis of HK-2 cells as indicated in the significantly reduced levels of Bax and c-Caspase-3 proteins. Overall, miR-30b promoted LPS-induced HK-2 cell inflammatory injury by inducing the apoptosis and by releasing inflammatory cytokines, as well as by impairing autophagy process.",PubMed

Abstract
OBJECTIVES:

Although environmental exposure to multiple metals is common, epidemiological studies on the associations of exposure to 23 metals with kidney function have not been analyzed. We aimed to investigate the associations of 23 metals levels with renal function.
METHODS:

We conducted a cross-sectional study in four rural regions of Hunan province. Plasma and urine metals levels were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Two-level logistic regression was used to investigate the associations of metals levels with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with adjustment for confounding factors. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of the results using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.
RESULTS:

A total of 3553 participants completed the investigation. Five metals (plasma arsenic and molybdenum; urine copper, rubidium, and strontium) were identified to be significantly associated with renal function. Participants in the highest quartile of plasma arsenic and molybdenum were at 17.95 (95% CI: 6.35-50.76) and 24.23 (95% CI: 7.42-79.19) fold risk of abnormal eGFR, respectively, compared with the lowest quartile. The highest quartiles of urine copper, rubidium, and strontium were associated with 3.70 (95% CI:1.92-7.14), 0.16 (95% CI:0.07-0.37) and 0.08 (95% CI: 0.03-0.21) fold risk of abnormal eGFR. The sensitivity analysis revealed that plasma arsenic, molybdenum and urine copper, rubidium and strontium levels retained similar associations with abnormal eGFR.
CONCLUSION:

Plasma arsenic and molybdenum, and urine copper are risk factors for abnormal renal function, while urine rubidium and strontium are protective factors for renal function.",PubMed

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Thyroid hormones have been associated with renal dysfunction in cross-sectional studies. However, prospective studies exploring the effect of thyroid hormones on renal function decline were sparse and got contradictive results. We aimed to prospectively explore the associations of thyroid hormones with incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) and rapid decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in Chinese adults.
METHODS:

The participants were from a community-based cohort including 2103 individuals aged 40 years or above without CKD at baseline. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxin (FT4) were measured by radioimmunoassay at baseline. Serum creatinine, urinary creatinine and albumin were measured at baseline and follow-up. CKD was defined as eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ò30 mg/g. Rapid eGFR decline was defined as an annual eGFR decline >3 ml/min/1.73 m2.
RESULTS:

During 4 years of follow-up, 198 participants developed CKD and 165 experienced rapid eGFR decline. Compared to tertile 1, tertile 3 of FT4 levels were associated with 1.88-folds (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-2.77) increased risk of incident CKD; and 1.64-folds (95% CI, 1.07-2.50) increased risk of rapid eGFR decline (both P for trend ó0.02), after adjustment for confounders. Each 1-pmol/l of FT4 was associated with 12% increased risk of incident CKD and 10% of rapid eGFR decline. Among the incident CKD individuals, FT4 was significantly associated with higher risk of concurrent complications and further outcomes of CKD. We did not find associations of FT3 or TSH with CKD or rapid eGFR decline.
CONCLUSIONS:

Higher FT4, but not TSH and FT3, was associated with increased risk of incident CKD and rapid eGFR decline in middle-aged and elderly Chinese.",PubMed

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Among populations with established chronic kidney disease (CKD), metabolic acidosis is associated with more rapid progression of kidney disease. The association of serum bicarbonate concentrations with early declines in kidney function is less clear.
STUDY DESIGN:

Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS:

5,810 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 60mL/min/1.73 m(2) using the CKD-EPI (CKD Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine-cystatin C equation.
PREDICTORS:

Serum bicarbonate concentrations.
OUTCOMES:

Rapid kidney function decline (eGFR decline > 5% per year) and incident reduced eGFR (eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73 m(2) with minimum rate of eGFR loss of 1 mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year).
RESULTS:

Average bicarbonate concentration was 23.2 ñ 1.8mEq/L. 1,730 (33%) participants had rapid kidney function decline, and 487 had incident reduced eGFR during follow-up. Each 1-SD lower baseline bicarbonate concentration was associated with 12% higher adjusted odds of rapid kidney function decline (95% CI, 6%-20%) and higher risk of incident reduced eGFR (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20) in models adjusting for demographics, baseline eGFR, albuminuria, and CKD risk factors. The OR for the associations of bicarbonate level < 21 mEq/L relative to 23-24 mEq/L was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.05-1.73) for rapid kidney function decline, and the incidence rate ratio was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.83-1.62) for incident reduced eGFR.
LIMITATIONS:

Cause of metabolic acidosis cannot be determined in this study.
CONCLUSIONS:

Lower serum bicarbonate concentrations are associated independently with rapid kidney function decline independent of eGFR or albuminuria in community-living persons with baseline eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). If confirmed, our findings suggest that metabolic acidosis may indicate either early kidney disease that is not captured by eGFR or albuminuria or may have a causal role in the development of eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Occupational and environmental exposures to toxic metals are established risk factors for the development of hypertension and kidney disease in adults. There is some evidence of developmental metal nephrotoxicity in children and from animal studies; however, to our knowledge no previous studies have examined associations between co-exposure to nephrotoxic environmental metals and children's kidney health.
OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this study was to assess the association between co-exposure to lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As), measured in urine and blood, and kidney parameters in US adolescents.
METHODS:

We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a subsample of 2709 children aged 12-19 participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2009 and 2014. We analyzed urine levels of 4 nephrotoxic metals selected a priori (As, Cd, Pb and Hg), Umix, and 3 nephrotoxic metals in blood (Cd, Pb, and Hg), Bmix, using a weighted quantile sum (WQS) approach. We applied WQS regression to analyze the association of Bmix and Umix with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum uric acid (SUA), urine albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and systolic blood pressure (SBP), adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, age, head of household's education level, height, BMI, serum cotinine, and NHANES cohort year. Umix and urine albumin models were also adjusted for urine creatinine, and Bmix models were also adjusted for fish consumption. Subanalyses included stratification by sex and an arsenic-only model including six speciated forms of As measured in urine.
RESULTS:

In WQS regression models, each decile increase of Umix was associated with 1.6% (95% CI: 0.5, 2.8) higher BUN, 1.4% (95% CI: 0.7, 2.0) higher eGFR, and 7.6% (95% CI: 2.4, 13.1) higher urine albumin. The association between Umix and BUN was primarily driven by As (72%), while the association with eGFR was driven by Hg (61%), and Cd (17%), and the association with urine albumin was driven by Cd (37%), Hg (33%), and Pb (25%). There was no significant relationship between Umix and SUA or SBP. In WQS models using the combined blood metals, Bmix, each decile increase of Bmix was associated with 0.6% (95% CI: 0.0, 1.3) higher SUA; this association was driven by Pb (43%), Hg (33%), and Cd (24%) and was marginally significant (p?=?0.05). No associations were observed between Bmix and urine albumin, eGFR, BUN, or SBP.
CONCLUSIONS:

The findings suggest metals including As, Pb, Hg, Cd and their combinations may affect renal parameters, although potential reverse causation cannot be ruled out due to the cross-sectional study design. Implications of early life low-level exposure to multiple metals on kidney function may have far-reaching consequences later in life in the development of hypertension, kidney disease, and renal dysfunction. Longitudinal studies should further evaluate these relationships.

Abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

Elevations in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity troponin T are associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes. Whether elevations in these cardiac biomarkers are associated with decline in kidney function was evaluated.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS:

N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin T were measured at baseline in 3752 participants free of heart failure in the Cardiovascular Health Study. eGFR was determined from the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation using serum cystatin C. Rapid decline in kidney function was defined as decline in serum cystatin C eGFRò30%, and incident CKD was defined as the onset of serum cystatin C eGFR<60 among those without CKD at baseline (n=2786). Cox regression models were used to examine the associations of each biomarker with kidney function decline adjusting for demographics, baseline serum cystatin C eGFR, diabetes, and other CKD risk factors.
RESULTS:

In total, 503 participants had rapid decline in serum cystatin C eGFR over a mean follow-up time of 6.41 (1.81) years, and 685 participants developed incident CKD over a mean follow-up time of 6.41 (1.74) years. Participants in the highest quartile of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (>237 pg/ml) had an 67% higher risk of rapid decline and 38% higher adjusted risk of incident CKD compared with participants in the lowest quartile (adjusted hazard ratio for serum cystatin C eGFR rapid decline, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 2.23; hazard ratio for incident CKD, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.76). Participants in the highest category of troponin T (>10.58 pg/ml) had 80% greater risk of rapid decline compared with participants in the lowest category (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.35 to 2.40). The association of troponin T with incident CKD was not statistically significant (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.50).
CONCLUSIONS:

Elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin T are associated with rapid decline of kidney function and incident CKD. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the mechanisms that may explain this association.

Abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

Metabolomics is instrumental in identifying novel biomarkers of kidney function to aid in the prevention and management of CKD. However, data linking the metabolome to incident eGFR are sparse, particularly in Asian populations with different genetic backgrounds and environmental exposures. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the associations of amino acid and acylcarnitine profiles with change in eGFR in a Chinese cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS:

This study included 1765 community-living Chinese adults aged 50-70 years with baseline eGFRò60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. At baseline, 22 amino acids and 34 acylcarnitines in plasma were quantified by gas or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Annual rate of change in eGFR was calculated, and incident eGFR decline was defined as eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 by the end of 6 years of follow-up.
RESULTS:

The mean (SD) unadjusted annual change in eGFR was 2.2ñ2.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and the incidence of reduced eGFR was 16%. After Bonferroni correction, 13 of 56 metabolites were significantly associated with annual eGFR change. After multivariable adjustment of baseline covariates, including baseline eGFR, seven of the 13 metabolites, including cysteine, long-chain acylcarnitines (C14:1OH, C18, C18:2, and C20:4), and other acylcarnitines (C3DC and C10), were significantly associated with incident reduced eGFR (relative risks ranged from 1.16 to 1.25 per SD increment of metabolites; P<3.8E-03 after Bonferroni correction of multiple testing of the 13 metabolites). Moreover, principal component analysis identified two factors, consisting of cysteine and long-chain acylcarnitines, respectively, that were associated with incident reduced eGFR.
CONCLUSIONS:

Elevated plasma levels of cysteine and a panel of acylcarnitines were associated with a higher incidence of reduced eGFR in Chinese adults, independent of baseline eGFR and other conventional risk factors.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasing health problem worldwide. Recent studies have suggested the potential associations between exposure to metals and CKD events, particularly in participants with hypertension. However, relevant studies are limited.
OBJECTIVES:

We aimed to explore the associations of metal exposure with renal function in participants with essential hypertension.
METHODS:

Nine hundred and thirty-four participants with essential hypertension were recruited at the Department of Cardiology, Union Hospital, Wuhan, China. We measured the levels of chromium, cadmium, thallium and uranium in urine and calculated the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for renal function. Multivariable linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders were applied.
RESULTS:

After adjusting for potential confounders and other metals, doubling of urinary chromium or uranium levels decreased eGFR by 2.90 (95% confidence interval, 2.04 to 3.76) and 1.87 (0.58 to 3.15) mL/min per 1.73m2, respectively. Co-exposure to chromium and uranium was found to greatly decrease eGFR, particularly in women. Compared with those in the low exposure group, women with high exposure to chromium and uranium had a 11.36 (3.66 to 19.07) mL/min per 1.73m2 adjusted decline in eGFR. Higher urinary thallium levels were positively related to elevated eGFR in men. The adjusted increase in eGFR with doubling of thallium levels was 3.12 (1.14 to 5.10) mL/min per 1.73m2. Sex-difference in the associations of exposure to heavy metals with eGFR was also suggested.
CONCLUSIONS:

Our findings suggest that environmental exposure to chromium and uranium might contribute to a decline in eGFR in individuals with hypertension. The associations of exposure to heavy metals with eGFR might be sex-different. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings and clarify the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Inflammatory processes are very important in the development of kidney disease. Nevertheless, the association between white blood cell (WBC) count and the risk of renal dysfunction has not been well-established, especially in subjects without chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our study investigated the association between WBC count and kidney function decline in a Chinese community-based population with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ò60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
METHODS:

A total of 3768 subjects who were enrolled in an atherosclerosis cohort in Beijing were included in this study. EGFRs were calculated at baseline and follow-up using the CKD-EPI formula. The outcomes of this study were renal function decline (RFD) (a drop in eGFR stage along with a decline in eGFR of 25% or exceeding 5 mL/min/1.73 m2/year), rapid eGFR decline (an annual decrease in eGFR exceeding 3 mL/min/1.73 m2), and incident CKD (eGFR <60 min/1.73 m2 at follow-up). Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between WBC count and each outcome.
RESULTS:

On average, the subjects were 56.6 ñ 8.5 years old, and 35.9% were male. Of the participants, 48.6% had hypertension and 17.4% had diabetes. The mean (SD) WBC count at baseline was 6.1 ñ 1.5 ? 109/L. The mean (SD) eGFR at baseline was 101.1 ñ 10.6 mL/min/1.73 m2. After 2.3 years follow-up, the incidence rates of RFD, rapid eGFR decline and new CKD were 7.7, 20.9, and 0.8%, respectively. WBC count was significantly related to RFD, rapid eGFR decline and new CKD in the univariate analyses. Even after adjustment for demographic variables, comorbidities, medications and baseline eGFR, these associations remained. Moreover, similar trends in RFD were observed in nearly all subgroups stratified by each confounding variable. The increase in the odds of RFD associated with each 109/L increase in WBC count was significantly greater in subjects not undergoing treatment with lipid-lowering drugs than those not undergoing this treatment (P-interaction: 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS:

In conclusion, elevated WBC count served as a predictor of the odds of kidney function decline in this population, which supports the hypothesis that systemic inflammation may serve as a risk factor for CKD development.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

In populations with prevalent chronic kidney disease (CKD), lower serum bicarbonate levels are associated with more rapid CKD progression, but whether lower bicarbonate levels also are associated with risk of incident estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and CKD progression among community-living persons with predominantly preserved kidney function is unknown.
STUDY DESIGN:

Longitudinal observational cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS:

Well-functioning community-living elders aged 70-79 years at inception.
PREDICTOR:

Serum bicarbonate level measured at the time of collection by arterialized venous blood sample using an arterial blood gas analyzer.
OUTCOMES:

Change in eGFR over 7 years, and new eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) with a rate of loss of at least 1 mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year.
MEASUREMENTS:

Linear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate associations of baseline serum bicarbonate level with change in eGFR and incident eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).
RESULTS:

At baseline, mean eGFR was 84 ñ 16 (SD)mL/min/1.73 m(2), and serum bicarbonate level was 25.2 ñ 1.9 mmol/L. Compared with participants with higher bicarbonate concentrations (23.0-28.0 mmol/L), those with bicarbonate concentrations < 23 mmol/L (n = 85 [8%]) lost eGFR0.55 (95% CI, 0.13-0.97) mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year faster in models adjusted for demographics, CKD risk factors, baseline eGFR, and urine albumin-creatinine ratio. Among the 989 (92%) participants with baseline eGFRs > 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 252 (25%) developed incident eGFRs < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at follow-up. Adjusting for the same covariates, participants with bicarbonate concentrations < 23 mmol/L had nearly 2-fold greater odds of incident eGFRs < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.97-3.07) compared with those with higher bicarbonate concentrations.
LIMITATIONS:

Only 2 measurements of kidney function separated by 7 years and loss to follow-up due to intervening mortality in this elderly population.
CONCLUSIONS:

Lower serum bicarbonate concentrations are associated independently with decline in eGFR and incident eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in community-living older persons. If confirmed, serum bicarbonate levels may give insight into kidney tubule health in persons with preserved eGFRs and suggest a possible new target for intervention to prevent CKD development.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Serum albumin concentrations are a strong predictor of mortality and cardiovascular disease in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. We studied the longitudinal associations between serum albumin levels and kidney function decline in a population of HIV-infected women.
STUDY DESIGN:

Retrospective cohort analysis.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS:

Study participants were recruited from the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), a large observational study designed to understand risk factors for the progression of HIV infection in women living in urban communities. 908 participants had baseline assessment of kidney function and 2 follow-up measurements over an average of 8 years.
PREDICTOR:

The primary predictor was serum albumin concentration.
OUTCOMES:

We examined annual change in kidney function. Secondary outcomes included rapid kidney function decline and incident reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
MEASUREMENTS:

Kidney function decline was determined by cystatin C-based (eGFR(cys)) and creatinine-based eGFR (eGFR(cr)) at baseline and follow-up. Each model was adjusted for kidney disease and HIV-related risk factors using linear and relative risk regression.
RESULTS:

After multivariate adjustment, each 0.5-g/dL decrement in baseline serum albumin concentration was associated with a 0.56-mL/min faster annual decline in eGFR(cys) (P < 0.001), which was attenuated only slightly to 0.55 mL/min/1.73 m(2) after adjustment for albuminuria. Results were similar whether using eGFR(cys) or eGFR(cr). In adjusted analyses, each 0.5-g/dL lower baseline serum albumin level was associated with a 1.71-fold greater risk of rapid kidney function decline (P < 0.001) and a 1.72-fold greater risk of incident reduced eGFR (P < 0.001).
LIMITATIONS:

The cohort is composed of only female participants from urban communities within the United States.
CONCLUSIONS:

Lower serum albumin levels were associated strongly with kidney function decline and incident reduced eGFRs in HIV-infected women independent of HIV disease status, body mass index, and albuminuria.",PubMed

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Identifying potentially modifiable risk factors is critically important for reducing the burden of chronic kidney disease. We sought to examine the association of body mass index (BMI) with kidney function decline in a cohort of young adults with preserved glomerular filtration at baseline.
STUDY DESIGN:

Longitudinal cohort.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS:

2,839 black and white young adults with cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcys)>90mL/min/1.73m(2) taking part in the year-10 examination (in 1995-1996) of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study.
PREDICTOR:

BMI, categorized as 18.5-24.9 (reference), 25.0-29.9, 30.0-39.9, and ò40.0kg/m(2).
OUTCOMES:

Trajectory of kidney function decline, rapid decline (>3% per year), and incident eGFRcys <60mL/min/1.73m(2) over 10 years of follow-up.
MEASUREMENTS:

GFRcys estimated from the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation for calibrated cystatin C at CARDIA years 10, 15, and 20.
RESULTS:

At year 10, participants had a mean age of 35.1 years, median eGFRcys of 114mL/min/1.73m(2), and 24.5% had BMIò30.0kg/m(2). After age 30 years, average eGFRcys was progressively lower with each increment in BMI after adjustment for baseline age, race, sex, hyperlipidemia, smoking status, and physical activity. Higher BMI category was associated with successively higher odds of rapid decline (for 25.0-29.9, 30.0-39.9, and ò40.0kg/m(2), adjusted ORs were 1.50 [95% CI, 1.21-1.87], 2.01 [95% CI, 1.57-2.87], and 2.57 [95% CI, 1.67-3.94], respectively). 18 participants (0.6%) had incident eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m(2). In unadjusted analysis, higher BMI category was associated with incident eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m(2) (for 25.0-29.9, 30.0-39.9, and ò40.0kg/m(2), ORs were 5.17 [95% CI, 1.10-25.38], 7.44 [95% CI, 1.54-35.95], and 5.55 [95% CI, 0.50-61.81], respectively); adjusted associations were no longer significant.
LIMITATIONS:

Inability to describe kidney function before differences by BMI category were already evident. Absence of data for measured GFR or GFR estimated from serum creatinine level.
CONCLUSIONS:

Higher BMI categories are associated with greater declines in kidney function in a cohort of young adults with preserved GFR at baseline. Clinicians should vigilantly monitor overweight and obese patients for evidence of early kidney function decline.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Low ankle-brachial index (ABI) is associated with increases in serum creatinine level. Whether low ABI is associated with the development of rapid estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD), or microalbuminuria is uncertain.
STUDY DESIGN:

Prospective cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS:

Framingham Offspring cohort participants who attended the sixth (1995-1998) and eighth (2005-2008) examinations.
PREDICTOR:

ABI, categorized as normal (>1.1 to <1.4), low-normal (>0.9 to 1.1), and low (ó0.9).
OUTCOMES:

Rapid eGFR decline (eGFR decline ò3 mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year), incident stage 3 CKD (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), incident microalbuminuria.
MEASUREMENTS:

GFR was estimated using the serum creatinine-based CKD-EPI (CKD Epidemiology Collaboration) equation. Urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) was determined based on spot urine samples.
RESULTS:

During 9.5 years, 9.0% (232 of 2,592) experienced rapid eGFR decline and 11.1% (270 of 2,426) developed stage 3 CKD. Compared to normal ABI, low ABI was associated with 5.73-fold increased odds of rapid eGFR decline (95% CI, 2.77-11.85; P<0.001) after age, sex, and baseline eGFR adjustment; this persisted after multivariable adjustment for standard CKD risk factors (OR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.65-7.87; P = 0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, and baseline eGFR, low ABI was associated with a 2.51-fold increased odds of stage 3 CKD (OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.16-5.44; P = 0.02), although this was attenuated after multivariable adjustment (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.75-3.76; P = 0.2). In 1,902 free of baseline microalbuminuria, low ABI was associated with increased odds of microalbuminuria after adjustment for age, sex, and baseline UACR (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.07-7.37; P = 0.04), with attenuation upon further adjustment (OR, 1.88; P = 0.1).
LIMITATIONS:

Limited number of events with low ABI. Outcomes based on single serum creatinine and UACR measurements at each examination.
CONCLUSIONS:

Low ABI is associated with an increased risk of rapid eGFR decline, suggesting that systemic atherosclerosis predicts a decrease in kidney function.",PubMed

Abstract

Environmental factors contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease. However, these factors, and particularly the toxic effects of heavy metals, have not been completely evaluated. Chromium is a widespread industrial contaminant that has been linked to nephrotoxicity in animal and occupational population studies. Nevertheless, its role in population renal health and its potential interactions with other nephrotoxic metals, such as lead and cadmium, remain unknown. We assessed the association between exposure to chromium, lead, and cadmium with renal function using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in an analysis of 360 Taiwanese adults aged 19-84 years from the National Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (2005-2008). Doubling of urinary chromium or lead decreased the eGFR by -5.99 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% confidence interval -9.70, -2.27) and -6.61 (-9.71, -3.51), respectively, after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, sodium intake, education, urinary volume, and other metals. For those in the highest tertile of cadmium exposure, the eGFR decreased by -12.68 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% confidence interval -20.44, -4.93) and -11.22 mL/min/1.73 m2 (-17.01, -5.44), as urinary chromium or lead levels doubled, respectively. Thus, there is a significant and independent association between chromium exposure and decreased renal function. Furthermore, co-exposure to chromium with lead and cadmium is potentially associated with additional decline in the glomerular filtration rate in Taiwanese adults.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Whether elevations in levels of urinary biomarkers of tubular injury (urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL] and kidney injury molecule 1 [KIM-1]) are associated with future risk of kidney disease has not been investigated.
STUDY DESIGN:

1:1 nested case-control study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS:

686 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).
PREDICTOR:

NGAL and KIM-1 were measured at baseline, expressed as log-transformed continuous variables, and categorized into deciles.
OUTCOMES:

Kidney function was estimated by cystatin C level using the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) equation. Incident CKD stage 3 was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and an eGFR decrease >1 mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year, and rapid kidney function decrease was defined as decrease ò3 mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year.
MEASUREMENTS:

Cases were defined as persons with eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) who subsequently developed incident CKD stage 3 and/or had rapid kidney function decrease by the MESA year-5 visit. Controls were matched for age, sex, race, diabetes, and baseline eGFR. We adjusted for age, hypertension, and presence of albuminuria (albumin-creatinine ratio ò30 mg/g).
RESULTS:

Of 343 cases, 145 had incident CKD stage 3, 141 had rapid kidney function decrease, and 57 had both. Mean eGFR for controls was 81 ñ 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at baseline and 80 ñ 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at follow-up compared with 82 ñ 13 and 58 ñ 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for cases. Each doubling of KIM-1 level (in picograms per milliliter) was associated with an OR of 1.15 (95% CI, 1.02-1.29) for incident CKD stage 3 and/or rapid kidney function decrease. Compared with the lowest 90%, the highest decile of KIM-1 level was associated with an OR of 2.02 (95% CI, 1.15-3.56) for the outcome; these associations were independent of albuminuria. NGAL levels (in nanograms per milliliter) were not associated with incident CKD stage 3 and/or rapid kidney function decrease (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99-1.10). Results were similar when KIM-1 and NGAL levels were standardized for urine creatinine.
LIMITATIONS:

The case-control design limits the ability to account for persons who died or were not available for follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS:

Urinary KIM-1 level is associated with future risk of kidney disease independent of albuminuria. Urinary biomarkers of tubular injury are a promising tool for identifying persons at risk of CKD.",PubMed

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Racial differences in rapid kidney function decline exist, but less is known regarding factors associated with rapid decline among African Americans. Greater understanding of potentially modifiable risk factors for early kidney function loss may help reduce the burden of kidney failure in this high-risk population.
STUDY DESIGN:

Prospective cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS:

3,653 African American participants enrolled in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) with kidney function data from 2 of 3 examinations (2000-2004 and 2009-2013). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated from serum creatinine using the CKD-EPI creatinine equation.
PREDICTORS:

Demographics, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and clinical risk factors for kidney failure.
OUTCOMES:

Rapid decline was defined as a ò30% decline in eGFR during follow-up. We quantified the association of risk factors with rapid decline in multivariable models.
MEASUREMENTS:

Clinical (systolic blood pressure and albuminuria [albumin-creatinine ratio]) and modifiable risk factors.
RESULTS:

Mean age was 54ñ12 (SD) years, 37% were men, average body mass index was 31.8ñ7.1kg/m(2), 19% had diabetes mellitus (DM), and mean eGFR was 96.0ñ20mL/min/1.73m(2) with an annual rate of decline of 1.27mL/min/1.73m(2). Those with rapid decline (11.5%) were older, were more likely to be of low/middle income, and had higher systolic blood pressures and greater DM than those with nonrapid decline. Factors associated with ò30% decline were older age (adjusted OR per 10 years older, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.34-1.71), cardiovascular disease (adjusted OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.12-2.10), higher systolic blood pressure (adjusted OR per 17mmHg greater, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.41), DM (adjusted OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 2.02-3.41), smoking (adjusted OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.10-2.31), and albumin-creatinine ratio > 30mg/g (adjusted OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.08-1.21). Conversely, results did not support associations of waist circumference, C-reactive protein level, and physical activity with rapid decline.
LIMITATIONS:

No midstudy creatinine measurement at examination 2 (2005-2008).
CONCLUSIONS:

Rapid decline heterogeneity exists among African Americans in JHS. Interventions targeting potentially modifiable factors may help reduce the incidence of kidney failure.

To search for sequence variants that associate with CKD, we conducted a genome-wide association study(GWAS) that included a total of 3,203 Icelandic cases and 38,782 controls. We observed an association between CKD anda variant with 80% population frequency, rs4293393-T, positioned next to theUMODgene (GeneID: 7369) onchromosome 16p12 (OR = 1.25,P=4.1610210). This gene encodes uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall protein), the mostabundant protein in mammalian urine. The variant also associates significantly with serum creatinine concentration(SCr) in Icelandic subjects (N = 24,635,P=1.3610223) but not in a smaller set of healthy Dutch controls (N = 1,819,P= 0.39). Our findings validate the association between theUMODvariant and both CKD and SCr recently discovered ina large GWAS. In the Icelandic dataset, we demonstrate thatthe effect on SCr increases substantially with both age(P=3.0610217) and number of comorbid diseases (P= 0.008). The association with CKD is also stronger in the older agegroups. These results suggest that theUMODvariant may influence the adaptation of the kidney to age-related riskfactorsofkidneydiseasesuchashypertension and diabetes. The variant also associates with serum urea (P=1.061026),uric acid (P= 0.0064), and suggestively with gout. In contrast to CKD, theUMODvariant confers protection againstkidney stones when studied in 3,617 Icelandic and Dutch kidney stone cases and 43,201 controls (OR = 0.88,P=5.761025).",PLOS
"Decrease in Irisin in Patients with Chronic Kidney DiseaseMing-Shien Wen1*, Chao-Yung Wang1, Shuei-Liong Lin2,3, Kuo-Chun Hung11Department of Cardiology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan,2Renal Division, Department ofMedicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan,3Graduate Institute of Physiology, National Taiwan University, College of Medicine, Taipei, TaiwanAbstractPatients with chronic kidney disease have abnormal energy expenditure and metabolism. The mechanisms underlyingaltered energy expenditure in uremia are unknown and remain to be elucidated. Irisin is a peroxisome proliferator-activatedreceptorccoactivator 1-a?dependent myokine, and it increases energy expenditure in the absence of changes in foodintake or activity. We hypothesize that chronic kidney disease patients have altered irisin levels. We measured resting irisinlevels in 38 patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease and in 19 age- and sex-matched normal subjects. Plasma irisinlevels were significantly decreased in chronic kidney disease patients (58.59%; 95% CI 47.9%?69.2%,p,0.0001). Thedecrease in irisin levels was inversely correlated with the levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Further associationanalysis revealed that irisin level is independently associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Our resultssuggest that chronic kidney disease patients have lower than normal irisin levels at rest. Furthermore, irisin may play a majorrole in affecting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and abnormal energy expenditure in chronic kidney diseasepatients.",PLOS
"In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), total kidney volume (TKV) is regarded as an important biomarker of disease progression and different methods are available to assess kidney volume. The purpose of this study was to identify the most efficient kidney volume computation method to be used in clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of treatments on ADPKD progression.",PLOS
"The extent of scarring or renal interstitial collagen deposition in chronic kidney disease (CKD) can only be ascertained by highly invasive, painful and sometimes risky, tissue biopsy. Interestingly, while CKD-related abnormalities in kidney size can often be visualized using ultrasound, not only does the ellipsoid formula used today underestimate true renal size, but the calculated renal size does not inform tubulointerstitial collagen content. We used coronal kidney sections from healthy mice and mice with kidney disease to develop a new formula for estimating renal parenchymal area. While treating the kidney as an ellipse with the major axis (a) the polar distance, this technique involves extending the minor axis (b) into the renal pelvis to obtain a new minor axis, be. The calculated renal parenchymal area is remarkably similar to the true or measured area. Biochemically determined kidney collagen content revealed a strong and positive correlation with the calculated renal parenchymal area. Picrosirius red staining for tubulointerstitial collagen also correlated with calculated renal parenchymal area. The extent of renal scarring, i.e. kidney interstitial collagen content, can now be computed by making just two axial measurements which can easily be accomplished via noninvasive imaging of this organ.",PLOS
"Chronic kidney disease has become an increasingly significant clinical and public health issue, accounting for 1.1 million deaths worldwide. Information on the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease and associated risk factors is limited in the United Arab Emirates. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the incidence and causes of chronic kidney disease stages 3?5 in adult United Arab Emirates nationals with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease. This retrospective study included 491 adults with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease (diabetes mellitus or associated clinical disease) who attended outpatient clinics at a tertiary care hospital in Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was assessed every 3 months from baseline to June 30, 2017. Chronic kidney disease stages 3?5 were defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for ò 3 months. Multivariable Cox's proportional hazards analysis was used to determine the independent risk factors associated with developing chronic kidney disease stages 3?5. The cumulative incidence of chronic kidney disease stages 3?5 over a 9-year period was 11.4% (95% confidence interval 8.6, 14.0). The incidence rate of these disease stages was 164.8 (95% confidence interval 121.6, 207.9) per 10,000 person-years. The independent risk factors for developing chronic kidney disease stages 3?5 were older age, history of coronary heart disease, history of diabetes mellitus, and history of smoking. These data may be useful to develop effective strategies to prevent chronic kidney disease development in high-risk United Arab Emirates nationals.",PLOS
"Homoarginine is an amino acid derivative mainly synthesized in the kidney. It is suggested to increase nitric oxide availability, enhance endothelial function and to protect against cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to investigate the relation between homoarginine, kidney function and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Homoarginine concentrations are directly correlated with kidney function and are significantly associated with the progression of CKD. Low homoarginine concentrations might be an early indicator of kidney failure and a potential target for the prevention of disease progression which needs further investigations",PLOS
"The association of Helicobacter pylori eradication with the occurrence of renal dysfunction in patients with peptic ulcer diseases is still unclear. This study aimed to clarify the relevance of H. pylori eradication to the occurrence of chronic kidney diseases in patients with peptic ulcer diseases. Data that were available from 2000?2011 were extracted from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan, and all patients with peptic ulcer diseases (n = 208 196) were screened for eligibility. We divided randomly selected patients into an H. pylori eradication cohort (cohort A, n = 3593) and matched them by age and sex to a without H. pylori eradication cohort (cohort B, n = 3593). Subgroup analysis was further performed for H. pylori eradication within ó 90 days of the diagnosis date (early eradication, n = 2837) and within 91?365 days (non-early eradication, n = 756). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the association of H. pylori eradication with the risk of developing chronic kidney diseases and mortality. We observed that there were more patients suffering from chronic kidney disease in cohort B than in the early eradication subgroup of cohort A (8.49% vs. 6.70%, respectively, p = 0.0075); the mortality rate was also higher in cohort B (4.76% vs. 3.70%, respectively, p = 0.0376). Old age, pulmonary disease, connective tissue disorders, and diabetes were risk factors for chronic kidney diseases but early H. pylori eradication was a protective factor against chronic kidney diseases (hazard ratio: 0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.52?0.88, p = 0.0030), and death (hazard ratio: 0.69, 95% confidence interval: 0.49?0.96, p = 0.0297). In conclusion, our findings have important implications suggesting that early H. pylori eradication is mandatory since it is associated with a protective role against the occurrence of chronic kidney diseases.",PLOS
"In the United States, HIV-related kidney disease disproportionately affects individuals of African descent; however, there are few estimates of kidney disease prevalence in Africa. We evaluated the prevalence of kidney disease among HIV-infected and uninfected Rwandan women. In a well-characterized cohort of Rwandan women, HIV infection was associated with decreased MDRD eGFR. The prevalence of decreased eGFR among HIV-infected women in our study was lower than that previously reported in African-Americans and in other Central and East African HIV populations, although there was substantial variability depending on the equation used to estimate GFR. Future studies are needed to optimize GFR estimates and to determine the impact of antiretroviral therapy on kidney disease in this population.",PLOS
"Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier. Absolute renal levels of VEGF-A change in patients with diabetic nephropathy and inflammatory kidney diseases, but whether changes in the renal splicing patterns of VEGF-A play a role remains unclear. In this study, we investigated mRNA splicing patterns of pro-angiogenic isoforms of VEGF-A in glomeruli and whole kidney samples from human patients with kidney disease and from mouse models of kidney disease. Kidney biopsies were obtained from patients with acute rejection following kidney transplantation, patients with diabetic nephropathy, and control subjects. In addition, kidney samples were obtained from mice with lupus nephritis, mice with diabetes mellitus, and control mice. The relative expression of each VEGF-A splice variant was measured using RT-PCR followed by quantitative fragment analysis. The pattern of renal VEGF-A splice variants was unchanged in diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis and was stable throughout disease progression in acute transplant rejection and diabetic nephropathy; these results suggest renal VEGF-A splicing stability during kidney disease. The splicing patterns were species-specific; in the control human kidney samples, VEGF-A 121 was the dominant isoform, whereas VEGF-A 164 was the dominant isoform measured in the mouse kidney samples.",PLOS
