Diseases associated with HLA-DPB1 include Chronic Beryllium Disease and Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis. Among its related pathways are TCR signaling (REACTOME) and Phagosome. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include peptide antigen binding. An important paralog of this gene is HLA-DQB1. Binds peptides derived from antigens that access the endocytic route of antigen presenting cells (APC) and presents them on the cell surface for recognition by the CD4 T-cells. The peptide binding cleft accommodates peptides of 10-30 residues. The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules are generated mostly by degradation of proteins that access the endocytic route, where they are processed by lysosomal proteases and other hydrolases. Exogenous antigens that have been endocytosed by the APC are thus readily available for presentation via MHC II molecules, and for this reason this antigen presentation pathway is usually referred to as exogenous. As membrane proteins on their way to degradation in lysosomes as part of their normal turn-over are also contained in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, exogenous antigens must compete with those derived from endogenous components. Autophagy is also a source of endogenous peptides, autophagosomes constitutively fuse with MHC class II loading compartments. In addition to APCs, other cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as epithelial cells, express MHC class II molecules and CD74 and act as APCs, which is an unusual trait of the GI tract. To produce a MHC class II molecule that presents an antigen, three MHC class II molecules (heterodimers of an alpha and a beta chain) associate with a CD74 trimer in the ER to form a heterononamer. Soon after the entry of this complex into the endosomal/lysosomal system where antigen processing occurs, CD74 undergoes a sequential degradation by various proteases, including CTSS and CTSL, leaving a small fragment termed CLIP (class-II-associated invariant chain peptide). The removal of CLIP is facilitated by HLA-DM via direct binding to the alpha-beta-CLIP complex so that CLIP is released. HLA-DM stabilizes MHC class II molecules until primary high affinity antigenic peptides are bound. The MHC II molecule bound to a peptide is then transported to the cell membrane surface. In B-cells, the interaction between HLA-DM and MHC class II molecules is regulated by HLA-DO. Primary dendritic cells (DCs) also to express HLA-DO. Lysosomal microenvironment has been implicated in the regulation of antigen loading into MHC II molecules, increased acidification produces increased proteolysis and efficient peptide loading. "

Following phosphorylation, plays a role in cross-bridge cycling kinetics and cardiac muscle contraction by increasing myosin lever arm stiffness and promoting myosin head diffusion; as a consequence of the increase in maximum contraction force and calcium sensitivity of contraction force. These events altogether slow down myosin kinetics and prolong duty cycle resulting in accumulated myosins being cooperatively recruited to actin binding sites to sustain thin filament activation as a means to fine-tune myofilament calcium sensitivity to force (By similarity). During cardiogenesis plays an early role in cardiac contractility by promoting cardiac myofibril assembly (By similarity). "

Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include transferase activity, transferring phosphorus-containing groups and protein tyrosine kinase activity. An important paralog of this gene is MYLK3. Implicated in the level of global muscle contraction and cardiac function. Phosphorylates a specific serine in the N-terminus of a myosin light chain."
PI3,increased,PI3 (Peptidase Inhibitor 3) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with PI3 include Erysipelas and Impetigo Herpetiformis. Among its related pathways are Developmental Biology and Defensins. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity and peptidase inhibitor activity. An important paralog of this gene is WFDC5. Neutrophil and pancreatic elastase-specific inhibitor of skin. It may prevent elastase-mediated tissue proteolysis. Has been shown to inhibit the alpha-4-beta-2/CHRNA2-CHRNB2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and to produce a weak inhibition on Kv11.1/KCNH2/ERG1 and on the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) (PubMed:29483648). 
PLA2G2D,increased,PLA2G2D (Phospholipase A2 Group IID) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with PLA2G2D include Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome and Duodenal Obstruction. Among its related pathways are Oxytocin signaling pathway and Activation of cAMP-Dependent PKA. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include calcium ion binding and phospholipase A2 activity. An important paralog of this gene is PLA2G2A. PA2 catalyzes the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of the 2-acyl groups in 3-sn-phosphoglycerides. L-alpha-1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine is more efficiently hydrolyzed than the other phospholipids examined. 
RETN,increased,"RETN (Resistin) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with RETN include Diabetes Mellitus, Noninsulin-Dependent and Acquired Generalized Lipodystrophy.

Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include calcium-dependent protein binding and tubulin binding. An important paralog of this gene is STMN3. Regulator of microtubule stability. When phosphorylated by MAPK8, stabilizes microtubules and consequently controls neurite length in cortical neurons. In the developing brain, negatively regulates the rate of exit from multipolar stage and retards radial migration from the ventricular zone (By similarity)."
